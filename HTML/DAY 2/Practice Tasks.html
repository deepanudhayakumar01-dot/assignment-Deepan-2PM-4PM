    <h2>Task 1 </h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong> is the standard <em>markup language[a]</em> 
        for documents designed to be displayed in a <em>web browser</em>. 
        It defines the <strong>content and structure</strong> of web content
    </p>

    <h2>Task 2 </h2>

    <h1>History</h1>
    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>
        In 1980,<strong> physicist Tim Berners-Lee</strong>, a contractor at <em>CERN</em>,
        proposed and prototyped <em>ENQUIRE</em>, 
        a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo 
        proposing an <strong>Internet-based hypertext</strong> system.
    </p>
    <h2>Delivery</h2>
    <strong>HTML</strong> documents can be delivered by the same means as any other computer file. However, they are 
    most often delivered either by <em>HTTP</em> from a <em>web server</em> or by <em>email</em>
    <h3>HTTP</h3>
     <p>
        The <em>World Wide Web</em> is composed primarily of HTML documents transmitted from web servers to 
        web browsers using the <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</strong>
     </p>
    <h3>HTML e-mail</h3>
    <p>
        Most graphical email clients allow the use of a subset of HTML (often ill-defined) to 
        provide formatting and <em>semantic</em> markup not available with <em>plain tex</em>
    </p>
    <h3>Naming conventions</h3>
    <p>
        The most common filename extension for files containing HTML is .html. A common abbreviation 
        of this is .htm, which originated because 
        some operating systems limit file extensions to three letters

    <h2>Task 3 </h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Gotta love us brown girls, munching on fat, <br>swinging blue hips,<br>
        decked out in shells and splashes, Lawdie, <br>bringing them woo hips. <br>

        As the jukebox teases, watch my sistas throat <br>the heartbreak,<br>
        inhaling bassline, cracking backbone and <br>singing thru...

    <h2>Task 4</h2>
    <hr>
   <p>
    Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in 
    terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a 
    page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what 
    constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence 
    that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). 
    Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph.
   </p>
   <hr>
   <p>
    For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph
     can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences 
     that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,”
    because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.
