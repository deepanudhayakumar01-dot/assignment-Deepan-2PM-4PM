    <h1>Understanding the One-Paragraph Essay</h1>
    <p>
       A one-paragraph essay is exactly what it sounds like. A brief composition that consists of 
       a <mark>single paragraph</mark>. This type of writing is often used when you need to make a quick point. 
       Whether it's in a timed exam, a job application, or a short blog post. The challenge lies 
       in its brevity. You need to present a complete idea without the luxury of multiple 
       paragraphs to <mark>develop your argument</mark>.
    </p>
    <h2>Crafting a Strong Thesis Statement</h2>
    <p>
        The <mark>thesis statement</mark> is the backbone of your one-paragraph essay. 
        It's the main point you're trying to make, and everything else in 
        the paragraph should support it. A strong thesis is <mark>specific, concise, and debatable</mark>
