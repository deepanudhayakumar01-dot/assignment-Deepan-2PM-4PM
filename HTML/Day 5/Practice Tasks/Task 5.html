            <h1>How bettongs feed</h1>
            <p>
                Bettongs are nocturnal and spend the day resting in nests made of grass and leaves.
                 At night, they forage for food, using their keen sense of smell to locate fungi, 
                 roots, tubers, seeds, and insects. They dig with their strong forelimbs and sharp 
                 claws to unearth underground food sources. Bettongs play a crucial role in their 
                 ecosystem by dispersing fungal spores through their droppings, which helps 
                 maintain healthy soil and plant life.
